    Faith, madam, I have other holy reasons such as they
    are.

COUNTESS

    May the world know them?

Clown

    I have been, madam, a wicked creature, as you and
    all flesh and blood are; and, indeed, I do marry
    that I may repent.

COUNTESS

    Thy marriage, sooner than thy wickedness.

Clown

    I am out o' friends, madam; and I hope to have
    friends for my wife's sake.
