SCENE III. Rousillon. The COUNT's palace.

    Enter COUNTESS, Steward, and Clown 

COUNTESS

    I will now hear; what say you of this gentlewoman?

Steward

    Madam, the care I have had to even your content, I
    wish might be found in the calendar of my past
    endeavours; for then we wound our modesty and make
    foul the clearness of our deservings, when of
    ourselves we publish them.

COUNTESS

    What does this knave here? Get you gone, sirrah:
    the complaints I have heard of you I do not all
    believe: 'tis my slowness that I do not; for I know
    you lack not folly to commit them, and have ability
    enough to make such knaveries yours.

Clown

    'Tis not unknown to you, madam, I am a poor fellow.

COUNTESS

    Well, sir.
